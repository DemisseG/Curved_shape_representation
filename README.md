## GENERAL INFORMATION 
The software is the implementation of curved shape representation
and modelling discussed in:
* Demisse, G.G, Aouada,D, Ottersten, B. *Similarity Metric For Curved
  Shapes in Eculidean Space.*, IEEE CVPR 2016.
* Demisse, G.G, Aouada,D, Ottersten, B. *Deformation Based Curved Shape
  Representation*. Submitted to TPAMI.<br />
*If you use the software in any way or form cite the papers listed above.*
   
## Organization
There are three main folders:
* Classes  - includes static and value classes.
* 3rdparty - includes third party codes.
* DP_opt   - includes dynamic programming based optimizations.

## Example dataset
