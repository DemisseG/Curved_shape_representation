# Curved_shape_representation
This README.md file was generated on 2017/01/16/ by Girum G Demisse.

## GENERAL INFORMATION 
The software is the implementation of curved shape representation
and modelling discussed in:
* Demisse, G.G, Aouada,D, Ottersten, B. *Similarity Metric For Curved
  Shapes in Eculidean Space.*, IEEE CVPR 2016.
* Demisse, G.G, Aouada,D, Ottersten, B. *Deformation Based Curved Shape
  Representation*. Submitted to TPAMI.<br />
*If you use the software in any way or form cite the papers listed above.*
   
## Organization
There are three main folders:
* Classes  - includes static and value classes.
* 3rdparty - includes third party codes.
* DP_opt   - includes dynamic programming based optimizations.

## Example dataset
Curved shapes, extracted from kimia99, are included.
* Each coloumn of "kimia99.mat" has 11 elements from the same category.

## HOW TO:
Three demo scripts are included with the package.
* Demo_HOWTO_curve_representation.m - 
* Demo_HOWTO_curve_model.m - 
* Demo_HOWTO_deformation_transfer.m -
